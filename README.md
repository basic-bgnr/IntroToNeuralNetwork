### Intro to Neural Network  

Tracking my progress through Michael Nielson's Introductory Neural Network book [Neural Network and Machine Learning](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap1.html)

### Runnning 
Run the following from the current directory (python >= 3.8)

```
git pull https://github.com/basic-bgnr/IntroToNeuralNetwork.git
python3 -m pip install -r Requirements.txt
./init_dataset.sh
./run_prog.py
```
* installs the dependencies
* pulls the mnist dataset into the `./mnist_dataset` folder.
* runs the program

Neural net hyper-parameters can be adjusted by editing `run_prog.py` file as needed.
